# Algorithms

This repo contains some practice code for implementing various algorithms

## Listing of code

* linearSearch.js - implements a linear search to find the index of a target within an array.
* binarySearch.js - implements a binary search function to find the index of a target within an array.
* recursiveBinarySearch.js - implements a binary search function that uses recursion to find the target within an array.

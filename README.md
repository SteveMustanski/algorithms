# Algorithms

This repo contains some practice code for implementing various algorithms in javascript.

The exercises are from the Treehouse track "Algorithms and Data Structures".  In the course, these functions are written in Python to show the
examples.  This repo contains those examples written in javascript.

## Listing of code

* linearSearch.js - implements a linear search to find the index of a target within an array.
* binarySearch.js - implements a binary search function to find the index of a target within an array.
* recursiveBinarySearch.js - implements a binary search function that uses recursion to find the target within an array.

## Running the examples

To run the examples, you will need to have node installed on your machine.

To execute a function you can type
`node function_name`

For exampele, to execute binarySearch.js, run the following command
`node binarySearch.js`
